# Contributing to *vagrant-manaager*

## Pull Requests
PRs are welcome, but before implementing a feature, please open an Issue first, so we can be sure that no-one else is working on it and that the changes will be accepted.

Other thinks to keep in mind:
- write tests if possible
- add yourself to [README](https://github.com/absalomedia/minser#contributors)
- add your changes to [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/absalomedia/minserblob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- do not edit version number
- keep the [code style](http://standardjs.com/)
- edit screenshots in [README](https://github.com/hovancik/stretchly/blob/master/README.md) if needed
- be nice and have fun ;]

Thanks for your interest in making *vagrat-manager* better!
